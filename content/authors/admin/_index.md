I’m a Computer Science PhD candidate at Cornell University advised by [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) and collaborating with [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/) on problems around [instant-runoff voting](category/voting/). More broadly, I’m interested in modeling and understanding human preferences through algorithmic and machine learning methods. During my PhD, I've interned at Microsoft Research with [Jennifer Neville](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/) on [recommendations in networks](http://cs.cornell.edu/~kt/publication/2023-tomlinson-workplace-recommendation/) and at Microsoft's [Office of Applied Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/office-of-applied-research/) with [Longqi Yang](https://ylongqi.com/) and [Mengting Wan](https://mengtingwan.github.io/) on [multi-organization recommendation](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kt/publication/2023-tomlinson-targeted-training/). In Winter and Spring 2023, I was a visiting instructor at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/computer-science/) teaching Data Structures and Mathematics of Computer Science. 

I'll be wrapping up my PhD this summer and joining the [Augmented Learning and Reasoning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/augmented-learning-and-reasoning/) group at Microsoft Research!


When away from my desk, I spend my time playing [guitar](guitar), building [8-bit computers](category/6502/), playing [video](https://www.metacritic.com/game/celeste/) [games](https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-dread/), [biking](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44494577), listening to [music](https://youtu.be/SKJ5JyuP7WY), flying [quadcopters](https://google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=armattan+chameleon+build), [bouldering](https://scl.cornell.edu/coe/lindseth-climbing-center), and playing [pool](https://wpapool.com/rules-of-play/). I have additional interests in [spaceflight](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/orion-spacecraft/), [Premier League football](https://www.premierleague.com), and [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com).

<!-- I did my undergrad at Carleton College in the lovely town of Northfield, MN. At Carleton, I worked with [David Liben-Nowell](http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dlibenno/) on algorithms for [reconstructing the spread of chain-letter emails]({{< ref "/publication/2020-commins-diverging-string-sequences" >}}) and [Layla Oesper](http://www.cs.carleton.edu/faculty/loesper/) on problems related to [inferring the evolutionary history of cancer tumors]({{< ref "/categories/computational-biology">}}). My undergraduate capstone projects ("comps") were [a survey of blockchains](http://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/1819/jondich3/final-results/pages/home.html), advised by [Jeff Ondich](http://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/jondich/), and lectures on [the combinatorics of symmetric functions](https://bookstore.ams.org/stml-91), advised by [Eric Egge](https://www.ericegge.net).  -->

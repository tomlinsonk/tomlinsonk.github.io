title: "CV of Failures"
subtitle: "A summary of my non-accomplishments."
summary: "You may have heard of this before; academic websites, CVs, and Twitter feeds typically catalogue successes, obscuring the many failures and rejections that are a natural part of any academic career. Following many others, and in the spirit of openness, here is a CV of my own failures."

*Update: Danielle Braff wrote a [nice NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/25/style/college-rejection-parties.html?smid=url-share) about academic rejection and used my CV of Failures as an example!*

If you haven't heard of Failure CVs, take a look at [Melanie Stefan's *Nature* article](https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a), this [*NY Times* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), or [Princeton professor Johannes Haushofer's](http://johanneshaushofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf) (*edit: now at the National University of Singapore*). I think it's a nice way to remain grounded and to acknowledge the fact that rejections are a normal part of academic life that we don't often present, especially online. In the spirit of these articles (and inspired by my recent NDSEG Fellowship rejection), here's my CV of Failures, which I'll continue to update over time along with my regular CV:

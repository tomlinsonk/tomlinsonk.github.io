I recently assembled a [Stratocaster-style Harley Benton electric guitar kit](https://www.thomannmusic.com/harley_benton_eguitar_kit.htm), which included a few tricky things I had never done (staining and finishing wood, using a jigsaw). I think it turned out pretty great, despite a couple hiccups along the way.

## The kit
![](images/1-kit.jpg)
The electronics come assembled and fitted into the pickguard, but the body is unfinished and the headstock is quite blocky. The body I got had pretty rough routing marks in the cavities, so step one was sanding it as smooth as I could.


## Safety
Stains, finishes, and sawdust can be pretty bad for your lungs, so I did the build outdoors with a dust mask to filter out wood particles. I also used safety glasses while sawing and drilling. 


## Staining and finishing the body
I picked out some [Minwax Espresso](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Minwax-Wood-Finish-Espresso-Oil-Based-Interior-Stain-Actual-Net-Contents-32-fl-oz/999913881) stain at Lowe's to get a nice dark color on the body. I started out staining the back of the guitar to make sure it looked okay. To apply the stain, I first wiped on some [pre-stain conditioner](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Minwax-32-fl-oz-Wood-Conditioner/999913699) with a rag and then wiped on stain. As soon as I stained the back, I noticed that I had left a lot of scratches from sanding (visible in later pics), so I spent longer smoothing out the front once the back stain had dried. Here's what the front looked like after staining:
![](images/2-stain.jpg)
A few scratches, but I was happy with the color overall. Next, I applied three coats of [shellac](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Zinsser-Bulls-Eye-Clear-Shellac-Actual-Net-Contents-32-fl-oz/3449840) with a paintbrush, waiting an hour between coats and sanding the two base coats with 220-grit. Here's the guitar drying after one of the coats: 
![](images/3-shellac.jpg)
Once the final coat dried thoroughly, I buffed it with some fine 0000 steel wool, which gave it a nice satin finish:
![](images/4-buff.jpg)
I think the shellac I got was quite old, since it ended up having a bit of a varnish-y smell. I'd probably try using a spray-on lacquer if I did this again.

## Shaping the headstock
I printed out a headstock template I liked (from a [Gibson Firebird](https://www.electricherald.com/gibson-firebird-studio-guitar-template/)--a little narrower than the traditional [Fender Stratocaster](https://www.electricherald.com/fender-stratocaster-templates/) headstock). I bought a [cheap jigsaw](https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/power-saws/jig-saws/5-amp-tool-free-variable-speed-orbital-jig-saw-69582.html) and (after reading the manual and watching several instructional videos about safe jigsaw use) started carving out the shape:
![](images/5-headstock.jpg)
Because of the base of the jigsaw and the guitar neck, I couldn't quite reach the line I wanted, which resulted in making several jagged cuts:
![](images/6-headstock.jpg)
If I had been thinking, I would have turned the neck over and done the cut on the reverse side... Oh well. Nothing a heavy dose of sanding couldn't fix:
![](images/8-headstock.jpg)
Very happy with the final headstock shape!

## Tuners, bridge, and tremolo springs
Installing the tuners was straightforward--just some screws and nuts:
![](images/9-tuners.jpg)
The bridge mounting holes were very unevenly drilled into the body, so I had to expand two of the holes with a drill:
 ![](images/10-bridge.jpg)
Next, I installed the spring claw and attached the springs to the bridge (notice my horrendous sanding ðŸ˜… let's call it part of the home-built aesthetic):
  ![](images/14-springs.jpg)
 The hooks on the springs were quite roughly cut and initially didn't fit into the holes in the sustain block, so I had to file them down. Not a big issue.

## Electronics
Next, I attached the pickguard (with pre-installed pickups, volume/tone knobs, and switch):
  ![](images/15-pickguard.jpg)
and then soldered the ground wire to the claw:
  ![](images/17-solder.jpg)
Not my finest soldering work, but the claw sucked up a ton of heat, making it hard to get the solder to bind. I also screwed in the jack at this point, which plugged in easily to the electronics. 

## Neck and backplate
Screwing on the neck and was backplate was straightforward:
  ![](images/19-neck-back.jpg)

It's starting to look like a guitar!

## Installing strings
![](images/20-strings.jpg)
At this point, I was very excited to test it out. Unfortunately, I realized when trying to install the strings that one of the tuning machines was defective and didn't turn at all. I popped over to my great [local guitar store](https://www.guitarworks.com) and they found a matching tuner!

![](images/21-tuner.jpg)

I swapped out the button so it matched the other 5 tuners. The replacement is actually considerably nicer, so tuning the low E is a much better experience than tuning the other strings (the stock tuners have a lot of play and uneven resistance when turning, but they're certainly usable). The tuners are my first planned upgrade.  

## The final product
![](images/22-final.jpg)
I'm so happy with the final result. After some additional fretwork and a good setup, it plays beautifully and I can't get enough of the classic strat sound. I used it as the lead guitar in a three-part cover of Fleetwood Mac's Rhiannon (the main solo starts at 3:17):

_Update_: I replaced the stock electronics (pickups, pots, switch, and jack) with a loaded pickguard from a Fender Player strat--a huge upgrade in quality and tone! I also added locking tuners and a custom waterslide decal. Here's a more recent recording with the guitar:
